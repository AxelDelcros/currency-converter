# Roadmap (backlog)

## Features

- [ ] Add a "see more" button at the bottom of the History table to fetch a database stored history
- [ ] Add a "professionnal" mode, to be able to increase the precision
- [ ] Add a chart that shows the tendancy of the rate adding a value at each rate refresh
- [ ] Add a projection of values "if the real rate at this time was current rate"
- [ ] Add a currency selector

## Epic

- [ ] Create a full custom CSS theme
- [ ] Store and update the "real rate" in an external API that would have been fetched every 3s (even as mocked updates)
- [ ] Create & use an atomic lib
